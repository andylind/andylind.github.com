This is a simple example of using the [Google Visualization API](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference) to create an interactive map. This map was used to help students explore different world events that occurred in the 17th century. Users can hover over different countries to view various facts. 

Here is my [Github project](https://github.com/andylind/worldevents17thcentury) with the source code.

Here is the [working demo](http://worldevents17thcentury.appspot.com/index.html).
