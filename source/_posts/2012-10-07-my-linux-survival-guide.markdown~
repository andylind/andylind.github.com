The commands below make up about 90% of what I do on a Linux system. Most of what I do from the command line involves ssh'ing into a server, searching through log files, checking on processes, and editing configuration files. Since I am not doing most of my development work directly on a Linux box, I often find myself forgetting how to do certain tasks, or not knowing how to do something on a specific server. I put together the small guide below with commands that are available on almost any Linux system. By learning these few commands, I have been able to navigate around and get what I need done in almost any Linux environment.

<pre>
#Login to a remote server
ssh [-p port] [username@hostname]
</pre>

<pre>
#List files in a directory with file information
ls -l
</pre>

<pre>
#See every process running on a system
ps aux
</pre>

<pre>
#Print the last 100 lines of a file
tail -100 [filename]
</pre>

<pre>
#Watch a log file as it grows
tail -f [filename]
</pre>

<pre>
#Look for a pattern in a file
grep [pattern] [file]
</pre>

<pre>
#Run an HTTP GET request to a url
curl [url]
</pre>

<pre>
#Change file permissions to read/write for all
chmod a+rw [filename]
</pre>

Here are a few example of common uses that I have for chaining commands together:
<pre>
#Look in the last 1000 lines of a file for lines starting with ERROR
#and print out the matching lines and the 5 lines above and below
tail -1000 logs/logfile.txt | grep ^ERROR -A 5 -B 5
</pre>
