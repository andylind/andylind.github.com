In the last few years, a number of really cool new technologies have started to enable more complex and interactive mobile apps. Offline applications, device APIs, local storage, and cross platform UI frameworks are enabling developers to build applications that previously could never have been created on the web.

This presentation is from a talk I gave recently on "Building for the mobile web". It's a high level overview of the mobile web and some interesting technologies that are behind mobile apps.
