This is a presentation that I recently gave on the distributed version control system [Git](http://www.git-scm.com) and how it can be used with SVN. In the presentation, I introduce the concepts behind Git, some of the main Git commands, and how to use git-svn. 

[Git-svn](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html) is a feature that ships with Git that allows Git to connect to a subversion repository and share changes. Using git-svn is one way to learn how to use Git while still maintaining a Subversion repository. 

You can see more of my git-svn work flow in [this post](http://andylind.github.io/blog/2012/05/11/Using-Git-With-SVN/)
