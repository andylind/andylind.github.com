  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been asked recently by a few different people, “What would you do if you wanted to learn to code”.</p>

<p>My answer has been to learn JavaScript, Python, or Ruby. It is easier than ever to get started learning one of those languages because of the large number of amazingly user friendly tutorials online. One of the most pain-free ways to get started with JavaScript, Python, or Ruby is by following the interactive tutorials offered by <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn">Code Academy</a>. Code Academy lets you write code and do tutorials right inside your web browser. This is awesome for beginners because they do not have to struggle through hours of local setup on their machine to get a runtime environment installed.</p>

<p>I think the next step after learning a little bit from tutorials is to read a programming book. One of the best ones to get started with would be <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> (free online).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Friday, I attended the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/twincitiespracticalagility/agile-day-twin-cities-2012">Agile Day Twin Cities</a> conference. The conference was centered around building a discussion about agile software practices and the main theme this year was learning.</p>

<p>I want to share some of the most interesting and thought provoking statements that I heard from the day. Each of these could probably be an entire post on their own, but I think that these anecdotes and insights really give a picture of the discussion at Agile Day and the focus on questioning the status quo.</p>

<p>The first speaker was <a href="https://twitter.com/davidhussman/">David Hussman</a>, who did a great job at getting everyone to question why they are doing things. Here are some of my favorite quotes from his presentations:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ask why. Why are you changing the process? Could you be doing something more valuable?&#8221; <br/>&#8220;Minimize output, Maximize impact&#8221;<br/>&#8220;Transition from thinking about how big something is to thinking if something is too big.&#8221; <br/>&#8220;One sign of a maturing agile team is that they stop talking about the code and they start talking about the tests that they need&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>Stemming from David&#8217;s talk, there was a lot of discussion on why we work in iterations and what life would be like if we moved beyond iterations.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Why does it matter if you don&#8217;t get done what you committed to in the sprint?&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>Another session that I attended was focused on pair-programming practices. During that session the speaker made a really good point about testing:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;What is the next test that you should write? The test that tells you the most about the system.&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>This point really hit home for me. I have been trying to transition to using more Test Driven Development (TDD) practices, and I think this could really help guide me in choosing the next test to write.</p>

<p>Throughout the day, I heard a lot of controversial statements about process and tools such as:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;JIRA is where stories go to die&#8221;, and &#8220;Project Management is a symptom, not a solution&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>There was a lot of support at the conference for sticky-note driven workflow, and a lot of backlash against project management tools. I think that was one of the things that I most disagreed with. I have really seen a huge benefit when using a tracking tool to share info about stories among a large team.</p>

<p>The last quote that I found really interesting was from one of the open-space sessions. The speakers described a really great technique that runs counter to a lot of teaching for gathering requirements (e.g. 5 whys):</p>

<blockquote><p>People do not respond well to being asked, &#8220;Why?&#8221;. Instead, ask &#8220;If that happened, then what?&#8221; or &#8220;Pretend you had that, then what would you do?&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>Overall, I thought the conference was really good, and I appreciated the focus on continuous improvement throughout the agile process.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spend most of my time programming in an IDE or in a text editor like notepad++ or gedit. When I ssh into a machine though, it is usually most convenient to use a command window for text editing. Understanding the most basic vi commands can be really helpful when you need to edit text from the terminal.</p>

<p>The first step for me to learn vi was to master just a few basic commands so that I would have enough knowledge to edit files. Below is the most minimal set of commands that you need to know to operate vi.</p>

<p>The key concept you have to learn is that vi has two modes. Insert mode and command mode. When vi is opened, it will start in command mode by default. This mode allows you to do things like run complex editing commands, save the file, and exit. Pressing &#8220;i&#8221; will take you to inset mode. Insert mode allows you to edit text that is in the file. Pressing esc will return to command mode.</p>

<p>It can be confusing at first to understand which mode you are in. If you want to be safe, you can always press &#8220;esc&#8221; and guarantee that you are in command mode.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The commands below make up about 90% of what I do on a Linux system. Most of what I do from the command line involves ssh&#8217;ing into a server, searching through log files, checking on processes, and editing configuration files. Since I am not doing most of my development work directly on a Linux box, I often find myself forgetting how to do certain tasks, or not knowing how to do something on a specific server. I put together the small guide below with commands that are available on almost any Linux system. By learning these few commands, I have been able to navigate around and get what I need done in almost any Linux environment.</p>

<pre>
#Login to a remote server
ssh [-p port] [username@hostname]
</pre>




<pre>
#List files in a directory with file information
ls -l
</pre>




<pre>
#See every process running on a system
ps aux
</pre>




<pre>
#Print the last 100 lines of a file
tail -100 [filename]
</pre>




<pre>
#Watch a log file as it grows
tail -f [filename]
</pre>




<pre>
#Look for a pattern in a file
grep [pattern] [file]
</pre>




<pre>
#Run an HTTP GET request to a url
curl [url]
</pre>




<pre>
#Change file permissions to read/write for all
chmod a+rw [filename]
</pre>


<p>Here is an example of a common way that I might chain commands together:</p>

<pre>
#Look in the last 1000 lines of a file for lines starting with ERROR
#and print out the matching lines and the 5 lines above and below
tail -1000 logs/logfile.txt | grep ^ERROR -A 5 -B 5
</pre>
